# the training repo for kubernetes

This lesson requires me to run a local MiniNuke server, and I currently do not have enough available ram on my system to support it.

I am going to look into upgrading my system, or perhaps moving this lesson to my main system. 

update: it took some configuring, but I am now setup to run this lesson on my windows 11 system. just more to learn
